# Echoes

Echoes is a small social media web app project with the motto: *"what stays after"*.  
The motto reflects the idea that posts, interactions, and impressions on social media leave a lasting mark, even after the moment has passed.

## Project Overview

The project includes four main pages:

### Authentication Pages (`index.html`) and (`login.html`) 
- HTML form validation is included.
- Password must be at least 8 characters long.
- The form points to `html/profile/index.html` on submission.

### Feed Page (`feed/index.html`)
- Displays a list of posts with thumbnails.
- Includes a search field and sorting options.
- A form to create new posts.

### Profile Page (`profile/index.html`)
- Shows a profile picture, username, list of user posts, follow button, and follower/following stats.
- The mobile menu works via simple JavaScript.

## Setup

- Built using **Bootstrap with Sass**.
- All Bootstrap dependencies are installed via **npm**; no CDN links are used.
- `package.json` includes scripts for development (`--watch`) and production builds.

## AI Assistance

AI (ChatGPT) was used alongside the module to help explain concepts and show examples of how things can be done for better understanding.  

Specifically, AI was used to:

- Explain Sass and Bootstrap styling, classes, and layout structures.  
- Help troubleshoot and understand issues.
- Guide where to find relevant Bootstrap styles and examples.

> Note: This change in the assignment regarding AI documentation came late, so it was not possible to track every interaction precisely. AI assistance was used for learning and understanding, not for writing the code directly.

## Repository

- All work is done on the `css-frameworks` branch.
